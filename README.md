# PROJECT_GEIMU

Version: Alpha 4.1


VIDEO DEMO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ2tp6DD_7A


This game runs on Python 3.5 with Pygame module https://www.pygame.org/

Visual assets are from FinalGateStudios (taken from here: https://finalgatestudios.itch.io/ninja-asset-pack)


This was once a project put in a private repository because I wanted to learn game dev/design. Now I'm confident enough to put it on a public one for anyone to see. 


Please keep in mind that this was primarily experiemental at first so there's a lot of copy/paste comments, uncommented blocks of code, and there's even some horrid coding practices that need to be fixed.
